To follow the courses, you would need an active **Azure Subscription** to experiment. Depending on who you are, you may use one of the following types of subscriptions:

**University-Provided Subscription**
: Some universities might have special arrangements with Microsoft to obtain a subscription, which is then distributed to all students. You should check whether your university offers such a subscription.

**Azure for Students**
: All university students are eligible for Free [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?{{ site.tracking }}) subscription. To get it, you would need to verify your student status. You can also get Azure for Students as part of [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

**Azure Free Trial**
: [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?{{ site.tracking }}) is an offer available to everyone, where $200 credit is provided for one month, with some more services being available for one year. A credit card is required to validate your identity.
