We have developed a list of open curricula available for you to use on GitHub under MIT Licence. If you are a student - feel free to clone the repo and start learning at your own pace; if you are an educator - feel free to use that material in your own courses. We also gladly accept contributions from the community. As an example, courses are translated into several languages by enthusiasts all over the world.

### Web Development for Beginners

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a typing game, a virtual terrarium, a 'green' browser extension, a 'space invaders' type game, and a business-type banking app, and will have learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer.

In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called classic machine learning, using primarily Scikit-learn as a library. Travel with us around the world as we apply these classic techniques to data from many areas of the world. Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.
